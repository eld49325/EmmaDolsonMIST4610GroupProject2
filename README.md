# Dataset
This data was pulled from the US Energy Administration and joined together for an easier analysis. Its a collection of major factors that play into C02 emissions, from the Production and Consumption of each type of major energy source for each country to its pollution rating each year. It also includes each countries GDP, Population, Energy intensity per capita (person), and Energy intensity per GDP (per person GDP). All the data spans all the way from the 1980's through 2019.

Feature Descriptions:
Country: Country in question
Energy_type: Type of energy source
Year: Year the data was recorded
Energy_consumption: Amount of Consumption for the specific energy source, measured (quad Btu)
- Quad Btu = 10ยนโต British thermal unit
Energy_production: Amount of Production for the specific energy source, measured (quad Btu)
GDP: Countries GDP at purchasing power parities, measured (Billion 2015$ PPP)
Population: Population of specific Country, measured (Mperson)
Energy_intensity_per_capita: Energy intensity is a measure of the energy inefficiency of an economy
- Calculated as units of energy per unit of capita (capita = individual person), measured (MMBtu/person)
Energy_intensity_by_GDP: Energy intensity is a measure of the energy inefficiency of an economy. It is calculated as units of energy per unit of GDP, measred (1000 Btu/2015$ GDP PPP)
CO2_emission: The amount of C02 emitted, measured (MMtonnes CO2)

# Question 1
People have employed several approaches to curbing CO2 emissions, ranging from policy changes and regulations to technological advancements and behavioral changes. Notably, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle announced they would limit their family size to two children, citing environmental reasons. This led some people to question if family planning is an effective solution to reducing CO2 emissions. Population growth has been linked to increased CO2 emisssions as  increased demand for resources, including energy, food, and transportation, which all contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. However, it is important to note that the correlation between population and CO2 emissions is not straightforward, as other factors such as economic development. Economic growth is often accompanied by increased energy demand for transportation, manufacturing, construction, and other sectors. This prompted us to ask the question:

Is there a stronger correlation between CO2 emissions and GDP or CO2 emissions and population?
